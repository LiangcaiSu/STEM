## Model Overview

## Getting Started
### Data Preparation
#### Tiktok 
Step 1. Please download the dataset ```final_track1_train.txt.tgz``` of IEEE ICME 2019 Grand Challenge Track 1 to the directory ```data/TiktokLarge/raw_data```. You can download the original dataset from [BaiduNetDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ktHIHVx6mJqKnZCNcvQ41w)(password:tk1c). Kindly be informed that the usage of this dataset is restricted to academic research purposes exclusively and it must not be utilized for any commercial or illegal activities. 

Step 2. Then, run the data preprocessing script as follows.
```sh
cd data/TiktokLarge
# Please put final_track1_train.txt under ./raw_data
# or modify the data set path in preprocess.py
python preprocess.py
```

### Reproduce Steps

In the next steps, we assume that the directory is ```src```.

#### Model and Dataset Configuration
We provided available model configuration file ```model_config.yaml``` and data configuration file ```dataset_config.yaml``` in the ```config``` directory. Please modify these two files according to your needs if necessary.

#### Reproduce the model performance
You can train a STEM model by running the following script.
```sh
python run_expid.py --expid STEM_TiktokLarge --config ./config --gpu 0 
```
For better performance, we provide the tuner to automatically search for optimal hyperparameters. For example, 
```sh 
# Please modify TiktokLarge_STEM_tuner.yaml to adjust the search space
python run_param_tuner.py --config ./config/tuner/TiktokLarge_STEM_tuner.yaml --gpu 0 1 
```
We also provide baseline implementations for comparing model performance. For example, 
```sh
# Shared-Bottom
python run_expid.py --expid SharedBottom_TiktokLarge --config ./config --gpu 0 
# MMoE
python run_expid.py --expid MMoE_TiktokLarge --config ./config --gpu 0 
# PLE
python run_expid.py --expid PLE_TiktokLarge --config ./config --gpu 0 
```
